# BRAKES.CBL 

This sample demonstrates some simple calculations using floating-point values (COMP-2). 

## Notes 

The sample program calculates the temperature change in a truck's brakes during a downhill run, given some initial values for the truck's mass, vertical displacement, and characteristics of the brake material.
