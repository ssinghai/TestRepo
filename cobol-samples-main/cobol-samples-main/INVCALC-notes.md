# INVCALC.CBL 

This sample demonstrates Cobol coding for typical business calculations.

## Notes 

INVCALC uses fake "invoice" data to illustrate business arithmetic in Cobol. We calculate the invoice total, extended prices of line items, and sales tax. You can see examples of various Cobol statements relevant to this kind of coding, including ADD, MULTIPLY, and numeric checks with IF. You can also see examples of how to format numerical data for output using the PICTURE clause of Data Division items.
